In this project I built a **Basic React Router Example** by applying react-router-dom.

### Refer to image below:

<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/routing-practice-output.gif" alt="routing-practice-desktop-output" style="max-width:70%;box-shadow:0 2.8px 2.2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)">
</div>

- When the **About** link in the header is clicked then the page should navigate to the `AboutRoute`
- When the **Contact** link in the header is clicked then the page should navigate to the `ContactRoute`
- When the **Home** link in the header is clicked then the page should navigate back to the `HomeRoute`
- When an undefined path is entered in the URL then the page should navigate to the `NotFoundRoute`
